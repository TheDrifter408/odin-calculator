# Odin Project: Calculator
This project requested a complete simple calculator with the UI too and was done using only flexbox. 

### Getting Keyboard support:
Keyboard support was achieved using the `keydown` event and checking which key was pressed, if the key pressed was a number between 0 - 9 or a operation key such as `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`.
